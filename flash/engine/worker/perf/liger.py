"""Liger fused-kernel gating for the fine-tuning worker.

Liger's fused linear cross-entropy is a MEMORY optimization (it never materializes the fp32
[B,T,vocab] logits), not a fixed-batch speed win, so it is gated by estimated model size. The
canonical thresholds live in ``flash.engine.vram`` (single source of truth shared with the cost
estimator's offline mirror). Heavy deps are imported lazily so this stays CPU-importable.
