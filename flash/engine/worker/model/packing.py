"""Architecture probes and tokenization helpers for the packed training path.

verl does the packing itself (``pad_mode: no_padding`` collates to one concatenated
``(1, total_nnz)`` row), so what remains here is deciding whether a checkpoint may take that path.
GDN hybrids (Qwen3.5/3.6) may only pack when the interpreter running the forward can reset the
linear-attention recurrence (fla's ``cu_seqlens``) and the causal conv (``seq_idx``) at example
boundaries -- without both, state carries across examples inside a packed micro-batch.
